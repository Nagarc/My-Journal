## Data Quality: Powering the Aerospace Industry’s Future  
The aerospace industry is soaring towards a transformative future. From AI-guided "dark factories" to electric air taxis and predictive maintenance, the vision is bold. But what fuels this ambitious ascent?  
According to the insightful [TCS Future-Ready Skies Study 2025](https://www.tcs.com/what-we-do/industries/manufacturing/future-ready-skies-survey-aerospace-defense):

- **Digital Threads & Twins Demand Trusted Data**
- **AI's Potential is Gated by Data Trust**
- **Scaling MRO Relies on Scaling Data Integrity**
- **The Bottom Line: From Data-Rich to Data-Intelligent**

### The Data Imperative  
This study highlights the critical importance of **data quality**, **interoperability**, and **availability** in realizing these transformative threads.  
After analyzing the perspectives of 323 industry leaders, a clear theme emerges: the industry’s multi-billion dollar bets on AI, Digital Twins, and resilient supply chains.

**The Ambition is Clear, But is the Data?**  
Key findings from the report:  
- 40% of aerospace production is expected to run as autonomous “lights-out” operations within 5–7 years.  
- 70% of Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) companies are already building commercial products.  
- 64% of MRO providers expect ROI from AI-driven maintenance within five years.  
- Nonetheless, only 28% of executives are confident they could pivot sourcing within 30 days of a major supplier disruption—a vulnerability rooted in data enablement.

Data is the foundation for modeling the supply chain, enabling 'tier-N visibility' beyond Tier-1 suppliers, powering digital twins for disruption simulations, and providing insights for proactive strategy.  
**Data doesn’t replace strategy; it makes it informed, predictive, and actionable.**

### Connecting the Dots: Technologies & Data  
Let's connect the dots between the report's highlighted technologies and the data that makes them work.

#### 1. Digital Threads & Twins Demand Trusted Data  
Digital twins—virtual replicas of physical assets—are among the top impactful technologies for 2035. Their value is unleashed by the digital thread: a connected data stream across the value chain.  
- **58%** of manufacturers have started implementing digital threads, but only **10%** have them fully operational.  
- The main challenge: data that is available but not fully integrated—underscoring the crucial need for high-quality, interoperable data.

> “In aerospace, resilience and precision depend on reliable, transparent data—it’s the foundation for AI, digital twins, and the next generation of intelligent operations.”  
> — Taylor Brown, COO and Co-founder, Fivetran

#### 2. AI’s Potential is Gated by Data Trust  
The aspiration: AI-powered real-time decision-making.
- Only **6%** of executives trust AI to fully automate supply chain decisions, mainly due to lack of trust in data quality.
- Human-AI collaboration, hinged on a trusted “single source of truth”, is essential for context and validation.

> “Complex decisions require a human in the loop to contextualize and validate. This fails without a shared, trusted source of data truth.”  
> — Naresh Lachmandas, Avasant

#### 3. Scaling MRO Relies on Scaling Data Integrity  
Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul (MRO) depends critically on data integrity:
- **80%** of executives foresee negative impacts—including revenue loss—if digital MRO efforts don’t scale by 2028.
- Predictive analytics and AI effectiveness are directly linked to operational data trust and accessibility.

> “Data continues to be a differentiator, with customers rethinking enterprise-wide strategies to fully leverage AI.”  
> — Ozgur Tohumcu, AWS

#### The Bottom Line: From Data-Rich to Data-Intelligent  
Technology is only the enabler. The real work is **simplifying and integrating systems** to make data **reliable, accessible, and actionable**.

> “Integration done right doesn’t just move data; it accelerates decisions, scales innovation, and turns complexity into a competitive advantage.”  
> — Steve Lucas, CEO, Boomi

**The winners in aerospace won’t simply have the most data, but the most reliable, accessible, and actionable data.**  
Innovation, collaboration, and sustainable growth depend on this transformation.
