# Dutch Culture \& Daily Etiquette Guide for Expats

## Introduction

The Netherlands welcomes people from all nations, but everyday life works differently than in many countries. Successful integration means understanding local **values, expectations, and etiquette**. This guide explains what’s important, what to do (and not do), and how to act in typical roles — **parent, driver, pedestrian, neighbor, student, worker, pensioner**.

***

## Core Dutch Cultural Values (For Everyone)

- **Equality**: Everyone is treated with equal respect. First names are common, and all opinions matter.
- **Honesty \& Directness**: Dutch people say what they think — openly, without hidden meaning. Feedback is direct, not rude.
- **Tolerance \& Open-mindedness**: Diversity is valued; people freely practice various lifestyles and beliefs.
- **Practical Thinking**: Problems are solved with simple, effective solutions, not long debates.
- **Work-Life Balance**: Personal time (evenings, weekends, holidays) is highly respected.
- **Modesty \& Simplicity**: Bragging is looked down upon. “Just be normal” (doe normaal, dat is al gek genoeg) is a popular phrase.
- **Punctuality**: Being late is seen as disrespectful. Always arrive on time.
- **Community Spirit**: Greeting, cooperating, and respecting common spaces is expected.
- **Environmental Awareness**: Cycling, recycling, and energy conservation are standard daily habits.
- **Freedom with Responsibility**: You’re free to live as you wish — but you must follow rules and respect others.
