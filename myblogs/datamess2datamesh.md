## Introduction

At each step and for each pillar in the data mesh architecture, perform a checkpoint analysis to customize the data mesh to fit your organization.

Despite a wealth of material available, making the right choices for data mesh architecture can be difficult. This blog clarifies data mesh in simple terms to help managers, developers, and architects.

## What is Data Mesh?

Data mesh is a highly distributed, microservice-based domain-driven architecture. It involves sociocultural and technical aspects around people, processes, technology, and data. It does not prescribe specific tools or cloud/on-prem infrastructure.

Core principles of data mesh include:  
- Serving over sharing or ingesting â€” owning the data and being proud to serve it  
- Discover and use over extract and load  
- Agile and evolutionary, encouraging curiosity and adding value  
- Decentralized, business-driven data products over central data warehouse, flexible and use case driven  

## The Four Pillars of Data Mesh

1. **Domain Driven Data Ownership**  
   - Data ownership at domain level by those closest to data  
   - End-to-end data architecture at domain level including design, build, storage, and delivery  
   - Domains can be defined by source, usage, business capabilities, or use cases  
   
2. **Data as a Product**  
   - Shift from send-and-forget model to owning, serving, engaging, and improving data  
   - Promote product mindset among data producers and consumers  
   - Governance processes for sharing and access with focus on accountability and quality  
   
3. **Self-Service Infrastructure Platform**  
   - Domain teams get access to data and infrastructure via self-service catalogues  
   - Enables zero dependency on central teams for scaling  
   - Include storage, compute, DevOps, encryption, networking, monitoring, and governance tools  
   
4. **Federated Computational Governance**  
   - Governance architecture to manage policies, processes, and roles across domains  
   - Maps to enterprise governance with clear accountability  
   - Covers metadata management, data privacy, security, catalogues, data quality, lineage, etc.  

## Functional Reference Architecture  

- Self-service data platform and core infrastructure for domain teams  
- Value-added routines for ingestion, ETL, and consumption  
- Federated governance tools for cataloguing, lineage, metadata, quality, and more  
- Domains build and manage their data products using provided infrastructure  
- Continuous updates and automation for data products
