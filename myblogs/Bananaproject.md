Bananas are very common and healthy fruits providing a lot of supplements such as minerals, Vitamins etc. It is the most common fruit available throughout the year in any corner of India.

## What is the problem

In India, mostly we get chemically ripened bananas most of the time across the street wherever you buy. This is a big problem.

## What is the impact of using chemicals to ripe Bananas

- **Shelf Life:** Reduced shelf life and resulting wastage causes huge loss across the value chain.  
- **Health:** Negative impact on health, resulting in an unhealthy society and increased hospital expenses due to health issues.  
- **Longer Logistics:** Farmers sell their produce to the local/city markets, from there it’s sold to small warehouse buyers who keep stock and ripen the bananas with chemicals and distribute to small shops. This results in a very long chain of logistics leading to less and unhealthy consumption.

## The benefits

- **The farmers:** Farm to fork. It's possible to market directly to the consumer, resulting in increased consumption and quicker time to market.  
- **Consumers:** Health benefit – naturally ripened bananas mean no chemicals used in ripening at least.  
- **Economics:** Shelf-life drastically reduces due to the use of chemicals, resulting in huge losses across the value chain.

## The Strategy

I would like to use small WhatsApp messages, YouTube short videos themed around Indian history and achievements made in the recent past and present to motivate the society using socio-cultural techniques to bond emotionally with the idea and progress to ripe bananas at home.

## Recognize the differences – artificial or natural

- **Original Taste:** I personally know what a naturally ripened banana tastes like. You have to experience it as I can’t explain how tasty naturally ripened bananas are.
